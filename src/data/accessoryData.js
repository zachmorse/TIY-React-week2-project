      'Store and protect your lens in the sturdy black Ruggard Lens Case 12 x 5". Featuring a thick layer of high-density foam padding and an overlapped zipper, your lens will be protected from accidental bumps, unwanted dust, and the elements when out shooting. Two adjustable tension straps ensure a snug fit within the case, and your lens cap can be tucked into the interior elastic mesh pocket under the lid when not in use. To transport your gear, you can attach the lens case to your bag or belt by way of the touch-fastening belt loop, take advantage of the adjustable shoulder strap, or carry by hand with the top grab handle. Its durable water-resistant shell and ripstop nylon interior withstands constant transport and use, allowing you to worry about getting the perfect shot instead of worrying about your gear.'
