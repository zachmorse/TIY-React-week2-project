    description:
      "Embracing their filmic heritage without losing sight of contemporary needs, the Leica M10 blends a pared-down physical design with enhanced imaging capabilities to produce an elegant and intuitive tool for still photography. Utilizing a redeveloped 24MP full-frame CMOS sensor and Maestro II image processor, the M10 yields high-resolution imagery with an extended dynamic range, high sensitivity to ISO 50000, and a continuous shooting rate of 5 fps. Separating itself from previous digital M rangefinders, the M10 features a slim body profile reminiscent of M film cameras, and the optical viewfinder's magnification has been increased to 0.73x for greater composition and focusing accuracy. The body design also incorporates a dedicated ISO dial for quick adjustment, even when the camera is turned off, and the rear 3.0' 1.04m-dot LCD features a Gorilla Glass cover to guard against scratching and light impacts. Also contributing to durability, the top and bottom plates are constructed from brass and the chassis is built from magnesium alloy to realize a robust physical construction for long-lasting use. Additionally, unique among M cameras, the M10 also sports an integrated Wi-Fi module for wireless sharing and remote camera control from a linked mobile device."

    description:
      "The Golden Half is a 35 mm half-frame camera. This means that each standard 3x5 photo is split into two 3 x 2.5 frames, allowing you to take twice as many photos. With a standard 36 exposure roll of film, you have 72 opportunities to make pure magic. The Golden Half may look like a toy but don't let its diminutive looks fool you. This pocket-sized camera features two shutter speeds as well as a hot shoe to strap on your favorite flash and let the low light pictures fly. It may be only half the size, but this Camera still plays with the big boys. The Half refers to the half frames that the camera captures. Half frame means that when you put a roll of 36 exposure film into the Golden Half, you'll actually get 72 pictures. You'll be quite carefree when shooting with it, and almost forget that you are still shooting film. It wasn't until we got our hands on this little beauty that we realized how seriously unique that this camera is. When your film is developed and printed you'll see two half frame images on each of your full-frame prints. This gives you a lot more possibilities, as sometimes two photos may fit better together than apart. You can start to tell micro-stories in two frames and you'll be thrilled to find connections - unexpected, and planned, between the shots giving greater insight into your photography. The camera is pocket sized so you can always have it with you so you'll never again miss an opportunity to capture a great shot."

      "The long awaited DH4 is here and well worth the wait. Incredible NEW FEATURES incorporated into the same chic retro styling that has made this series an International Best Seller for six years running, initially taking a camera shaped like an old 110 still camera and letting you shoot images as on a vintage super 8 movie camera. Well this camera takes both of those parameters and moves you into the 4th dimension. The Version Number 4 does not disappoint and exceeds any expectations in taking this little number across any time/space barriers heretofore known. The Digital Hedgehog is the most creative camera available in the market today. There is not even a close 2nd."
